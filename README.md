## JavaScript Types

JavaScript has dynamic typing. Don't need to define a type until assigned
- Value has a type, not a variable

1. Number
    - Floating point numbers
1. String
    - Sequence of chars
1. Boolean
1. Undefined
    - Empty Value
1. Null
    - Also means empty value
    - My guess is the difference is it's assigned null instead of being unassigned
1. Symbol (ES2015)
    - Value that is unique and can't be changed
1. BigInt (ES2020)
    - Larger numbers thatn Number type can hold
